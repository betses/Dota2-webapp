# DotA 2 Webapp

Dota 2 Webapp is a mobile web application to check the list of Items and hereos on DotA 2, that iscreated using React and Redux.

# Live Demo

Work In Progress

## Built With

- React, Redux, Jest, HTML5, CSS3, ES6, Tailwind

### Prerequisites

- You need to have Code Editor Installed
- Make sure Nodejs and NPM is installed in your system for linters and libraries

### Project Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

1. Clone the repo in your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/betses/Dota2-webapp.git
```

2. Open terminal and cd into project and install the dependencies

```bash
cd Dota2-webapp
npm install
```

3. run the command to open the project automatically in your brower:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
